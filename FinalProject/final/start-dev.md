# ðŸš€ Koseli Mart Development Setup

## Frontend (React) - Already Running! âœ…

The React frontend is now starting up and should be available at:
**http://localhost:3000**

## Backend Setup (Node.js) - Next Steps

To complete the setup, you'll also need to run the backend server:

### 1. Open a new terminal/command prompt

### 2. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

### 3. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set up environment variables:

- Copy `env.example` to `.env`
- Fill in your configuration (MongoDB URI, JWT secret, etc.)

### 5. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend will run on **http://localhost:5000**
